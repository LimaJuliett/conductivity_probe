### Designed to be 3d printed (I used a Prusa i3 Mk. 3), .stl units are mm


A piece of wire is to be inserted through each hole and secured (I used solid-core 22AWG wire and hot glue to secure it). Strip about a centimeter of insulation before inserting and gluing.
Each piece of wire can be plugged into a breadboard directly if you choose your wire accordingly.
The centers of the wire holes are 1cm apart, the protective half-circles are 1cm tall, and the body that holds the wires in place is 1cm tall. Engineering drawings available upon request (please submit issue requesting drawings be added if you need them).
